üåü Vision
At Bayesian Traffic-Prism our vision is quality cybersecurity should be free. Our mission is to democratize cybersecurity by providing enterprise grade open-source, transparent, and neutral tools that empower individuals, organizations, and governments to defend against evolving web-based threats. We believe that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and our platform bridges the gap between traditional WAFs and modern attack vectors like DOM-based XSS, session hijacking, and bot attacks.

Our ultimate goal is to become the "Hugging Face of Cybersecurity" ‚Äîa global, community-driven initiative that fosters collaboration, innovation, and trust in the fight against cybercrime.

üöÄ What is Traffic-Prism?
Traffic-Prism is an adaptive, AI-powered web application firewall (WAF) designed to complement existing WAFs like Nginx firewall, ModSecurity and DDoS FastNetMon. It provides advanced features such as:

DOM-Based Attack Detection: Protects against modern client-side vulnerabilities like DOM XSS, DOM SQLi, and Clickjacking.
Session Intelligence: Monitors user sessions in real-time, calculating risk scores to identify and terminate risky sessions automatically.
Bayesian Risk Inference (Optional-Consulting): Combines historical pattern analysis with Gen AI-based scoring to detect zero-day attacks and sophisticated threats.
Bot Detection: Identifies and mitigates sophisticated bots and automated browser attacks using Playwright/Selenium.
üîí Security Considerations
Traffic-Prism is designed to enhance web security but cannot guarantee protection against all threats.
Security is a layered approach; Traffic-Prism should be one component of your overall security strategy.
Regular security audits and updates to your entire infrastructure are still necessary.
Users are responsible for proper configuration and implementation within their environments.
üìú License
Traffic-Prism is licensed under dual license - Server Side Public License (SSPL) and Commercial one. SSPL license ensures that:

Anyone can use, modify, and distribute the software freely.
If you offer Traffic-Prism as a service (e.g., SaaS), you must also open-source your entire stack under the SSPL.
This protects the platform from being used without contributing back to the community.
For more details, see the LICENSE file. For end users there is no impact and they can freely use this software for their internal defenses.

Even if you are a hosted website like WordPress you can still host and avail this platform to track bots and prevent DOM XSS attacks.

üìã Commercial Licensing
For organizations requiring:

Custom implementations
Commercial support options
Alternative licensing terms
Enterprise features
Please contact us at pbi@bayesiananalytics.in to discuss commercial licensing options

We cover basic XSS / DOM XSS attacks in this code base. There are advanced XSS attacks/LDAP attacks that typically are experiecned by high risk websites such as banks. But to counter them we need to track lot more data points like XSS headers which may impact performance. So they need to be carefully considered and implemented in enteprise environment. We offer consulting services/ training on how it can be implemented.

Gen AI and LLM provide extra scoring engine that is highly effective against zero day vulnerabilities. Our software mainly risk-analysis.ejs has the placeholder to either include API or your custom model and directly get Gen AI risk scores. However owing to extreme dynamic nature and frequent changes (DeepSeek was recent such event) we have left it to end users to implement their Gen AI model. We will be happy to provide consultancy/training on how exactly such models can be trained. We highly recommened unsloth.ai for training your custom models.
