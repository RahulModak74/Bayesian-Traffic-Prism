Bayesian Traffic-Prism: Open-Source Web Security for All

You can use us alongwith any commercial WAF to detect and terminate behavior based bots, clickjacking, cross request patterns, DOM XSS attacks.

You can use us alongwith opensource static WAFs and you can match many of the features of commercial WAFs like bot detection and termination.

Quick Docker based installation:

1. docker pull bayesiancyber/structured-cyber:v1.0
2. docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 8124:8123 -p 9001:9000 -p 8001:8000 structured-cyber
3. Go to localhost:3000 (or IP:3000 if you are installting on cloud IP)
4. THIS IF YOU DO ON YOUR WINDOW MACHINE, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO STUDY WORKING REPO WITH OUR DUMMY DATA
5. Username/password: bluebot/bluebot123 and you can see details of protection available
6. If you are doing professionally then you have to do reverse proxy from 443 to 3000 on nginx(on your instance) and add lets-encrypt and then point your CNAME to the cloud IP from godaddy/domain provider.
7. Then add this CNAME in basic-tracking.js in the above repo and paste this pixel in header tag (inside <script> basic-tracking.js code </script>)  of all your web pages.
8. Details of enhanced version will be released later for advanced protections like polyglots and DOM-XSS as there is performance penalty.

üöÄ What is Traffic-Prism?
Traffic-Prism is an adaptive, AI-powered web application firewall (WAF) designed to complement existing WAFs like Nginx firewall, ModSecurity and DDoS FastNetMon.

Gen AI and LLM provide extra scoring engine that is highly effective against zero day vulnerabilities. 

Our software component risk-analysis.ejs has the placeholder to either include API or your custom model and directly get Gen AI risk scores. 

Professional Consulting: To develop custom modules, advanced attacks like Polyglot, Gen AI integration, Slow moving attack detection EDR capabilities rivalling or even potentially exceeding leading vendors and  reporting or for training / production support pl get in touch pbi@bayesiananalytics.in
