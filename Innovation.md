# Traffic-Prism: Revolutionizing Web Security with Behavioral Analytics

## Core Innovation

1. **OLAP-Enhanced Security**: Bayesian Traffic-Prism provides a revolutionary approach to web security by adding an OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) layer to traditional security stacks.

2. **Beyond Traditional WAFs**: While existing open and closed-source firewalls analyze web traffic as isolated URL requests, Traffic-Prism captures and analyzes complete user journeys.

3. **Real-Time Behavioral Analysis**: Traffic-Prism stores all user journeys in real-time in ClickHouse (a high-performance OLAP database) and applies behavioral rules to detect malicious activity:
   - Identifies suspicious patterns like 5+ URLs/second or 25+ requests/second from a single session
   - Provides evidence-based detection rather than relying solely on signatures
   - Detects DOM-based attacks that traditional WAFs miss entirely

4. **Complete Attack Chain Visibility**: Even for XSS and SQLi attacks that bypass conventional WAFs, Traffic-Prism:
   - Performs rule-based analysis of complete journeys
   - Assigns risk scores to sessions
   - Stores all data persistently for comprehensive incident investigation
   - Enables tracking and analysis of complex attack chains

5. **Real-Time Response Capability**: Traffic-Prism's two-way pixel allows for terminating risky sessions in under 300ms, providing protection against client-side vulnerabilities and behavioral threats that traditional WAFs cannot address.

## Cost-Effective Security Stack

6. **Comprehensive Protection**: A combination of static rule WAF (NAXSI or ModSecurity), Traffic-Prism, and FastNetMon for DDoS can provide protection comparable to commercial WAFs at a fraction of the cost.

7. **Benchmark for Evaluation**: Traffic-Prism provides an open-source benchmark to evaluate what additional features commercial WAFs offer, enabling cost-benefit analysis even if you ultimately choose commercial options.

## Advanced Capabilities

8. **Zero-Day Attack Detection**: LLM-based model integration offers exceptional potential for detecting zero-day vulnerabilities. Local custom models with Ollama or specialized trained models can handle emerging risks before signatures are available.

9. **Custom Risk Modeling**: Further risk customization is possible through PyMC3-based Bayesian models tailored to your specific environment and threat landscape.

10. **Advanced Attack Protection**: For high-risk installations like financial services, we offer consulting/training on handling sophisticated threats such as LDAP injections, header-based complex attack chains, and polyglot attacks.

## Data Sovereignty & Compliance

11. **Complete Data Control**: All security data stays within your infrastructure, making Traffic-Prism ideal for ISO 27001, SOC 2, and GDPR compliance.

## Implementation Services

12. **Deployment Options**: We offer 1-day, 3-day, and 2-week implementation assistance packages for organizations that need help with installation, rule configuration, and geographic settings.
