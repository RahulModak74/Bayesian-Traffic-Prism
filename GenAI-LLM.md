# GenAI & LLM Integration for Advanced Cybersecurity

## Overview
GenAI and LLM technologies provide excellent potential for zero-day attack detection and custom risk modeling. While our open-source solution offers robust protection, our specialized GenAI consulting services can enhance your security posture for high-risk environments.

## Implementation Options

1. **Ollama-based local risk models**: Custom LLMs thoroughly tested with direct integrations in risk-analysis.js
2. **Commercial API integration**: Directly implementable in risk-analysis.js (note: our focus remains on open-source models)
3. **Custom LLM training**: Tools like unsloth.ai offer efficient options for training specialized security models
4. **Emerging technologies**: New dLLMs (diffusion LLMs) from Inception Labs show promise for cybersecurity applications due to their ability to work with smaller, focused datasets

## Our Consulting Approach

Our GenAI consulting services help you:
- Develop custom risk models tailored to your specific threat landscape
- Implement advanced pattern recognition for complex attack chains
- Create specialized LLM prompts for your security context
- Train models on your historical security data for enhanced detection

## Engagement Options

For organizations requiring specialized GenAI and LLM implementations:
- One-day assessment and recommendation workshop
- Three-day implementation assistance
- Two-week custom model development program
