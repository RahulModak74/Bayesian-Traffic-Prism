Advanced EDR Threat Detection Scenarios

SCENARIO 1: ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT (APT) USING LONG-DWELL DELAYED EXECUTION

Background: A healthcare organization has been targeted by a sophisticated threat actor. The attacker has planted a dormant implant that remains inactive for an extended period to evade traditional EDR solutions that lack historical telemetry analysis capabilities.

Timeline of Events
Day 1 (March 1, 2025)

A phishing email with a malicious attachment is opened by user chris.wong@healthcare.org
The attachment exploits a zero-day vulnerability in a PDF reader
A small, encrypted implant is dropped to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\SystemData\temp\svchost.dll
The implant creates a scheduled task configured to only run after 45 days of system uptime
The malicious DLL has valid digital signatures and mimics a legitimate Windows system file
Day 45-47 (April 15-17, 2025)

After 45 days of system uptime, the scheduled task activates
The implant runs with low CPU utilization (< 2%) and minimal memory footprint
It begins scanning internal network resources on non-standard hours (2-4 AM)
The implant makes one outbound connection every 24 hours for 15 seconds to a legitimate-looking domain
Day 60 (April 30, 2025)

The implant begins exfiltrating patient data using steganography techniques
Data is embedded within legitimate-looking HTTP traffic in small chunks
The exfiltration occurs only on weekends and holidays
Detection via OLAP Telemetry Analysis
Process Timeline Anomaly:

Bayesian EDR's longitudinal analysis identifies a new svchost.exe process that only appeared after 45 days of uptime
The system flags the highly unusual activation pattern compared to process baselines
Low-and-Slow Network Activity:

Cross-correlation of network telemetry over 60 days reveals a consistent pattern of brief outbound connections
The system identifies that these connections occur precisely every 24 hours despite varying user activity
Memory Pattern Analysis:

Longitudinal RWX segment tracking shows suspicious memory segments in svchost.exe that don't match historical patterns
Memory mapping comparison across 45+ days identifies injection techniques
Historical File Integrity Verification:

Comparison of file hashes across 60 days reveals the originally dormant DLL has self-modified
The system flags modification of a file that remained unchanged for 45 days before suddenly changing
Behavioral Pattern Recognition:

The OLAP analysis correlates seemingly unrelated events across a two-month timespan
Bayesian probability calculations identify the execution chain despite the significant time gaps between stages

SCENARIO 2: CROSS-SYSTEM LATERAL MOVEMENT WITH DISTRIBUTED ATTACK PATTERN
Background: A financial institution is experiencing a sophisticated attack where no single endpoint shows enough suspicious activity to trigger alerts, but the attacker is moving laterally across multiple systems using legitimate tools and stolen credentials.

Timeline of Events
Week 1 (March 10-14, 2025)

Initial compromise of a contractor laptop via a malicious npm package in a development project
The attacker establishes minimal persistence using a modified Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) subscription
The attacker performs credential harvesting on the contractor's machine during nighttime hours
No malware is deployed, only PowerShell commands using built-in Windows tools
Week 2 (March 17-21, 2025)

Using harvested credentials, the attacker accesses 3 different workstations, spending less than 30 minutes on each
On each workstation, they run different reconnaissance commands:
Workstation 1: Network scanning using built-in net view commands
Workstation 2: Permission enumeration using PowerShell Get-ACL
Workstation 3: AD group enumeration using net group /domain commands
All command execution happens during business hours, mimicking normal user activity
Week 3 (March 24-28, 2025)

The attacker discovers a service account with access to the payments processing server
They establish multiple small-footprint access methods across 5 different endpoints
Each endpoint contains a different piece of the attack chain, with no single system showing a complete attack pattern
Week 4 (March 31-April 4, 2025)

The attacker accesses the payment processing server for exactly 4 minutes
They modify a transaction processing rule to redirect 0.1% of all transactions to fraudulent accounts
The modification is made using legitimate admin tools with valid credentials
Detection via OLAP Telemetry Analysis

SCENARIO 3: POLYMORPHIC FILELESS MALWARE CAMPAIGN WITH BEHAVIORAL EVOLUTION
Background: A government agency is targeted by a nation-state actor using sophisticated fileless malware that evolves its behavior over time to evade detection. The malware operates entirely in memory, modifies its own code, and adjusts its behavior based on the environment.

Timeline of Events
Month 1 (February 2025)

Initial compromise occurs through a spear-phishing email with a malicious macro
The macro launches a PowerShell script that injects shellcode directly into memory
No files are written to disk; all operations occur in memory
The malware establishes persistence through WMI event subscriptions and registry modifications
Initial C2 communication occurs via DNS TXT records, with minimal traffic
Month 2 (March 2025)

The malware begins to modify its own code in memory to evade signature detection
It changes its network communication patterns every 72 hours
System scanning occurs only when user activity is detected to blend with legitimate traffic
The malware migrates between different processes (svchost.exe, explorer.exe, etc.) every few days
Memory allocation patterns change dynamically based on the host environment
Month 3 (April 2025)

The malware begins to use legitimate Windows APIs for reconnaissance
It leverages different processes for different functions:
browser processes for data exfiltration
system processes for persistence
user applications for key logging
Data exfiltration occurs by hiding within legitimate HTTPS traffic
The malware's memory footprint continuously changes to avoid detection
