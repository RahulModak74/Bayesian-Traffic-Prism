From WAF to EDR: Bayesian Traffic-Prism Expands Its Cybersecurity Disruption 

Following the signficant adoption of our open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF), Bayesian Traffic-Prism is taking an even bolder step to democratize enterprise security. 

Building on the momentum and community response to our WAF solution, we're now extending our disruption to the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) market â€“ a space with significantly higher stakes and traditionally dominated by solutions with price tags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

We have opensourced some of the detection capabilities that many commercial vendors lack.

We have uplaoded synthetic data (attack_dats.csv) to test 3 advanced cyber attacks which are slow moving, the exact kind of attacks happening now which lay dormant for days and sporadically exfiltreates as compelx attack chains

full_detect.py is algorithms to detect attack vectors as identified the attack description file.

test_full_detect.py is runnig implementation.

cjs file is a sample referece implementation of agent to collect telemetry data in clickhouse.. In actual scenarios you may want to build it as exe in c++ or c# but thats ur choice. This is least resistance agent.

You can query clickhouse and extract data in attack_data.csv and run above python scripts for slow moving attacks.

Please note main value is using sql based detection in clickhouse and develop advanced queries for your scenario cross WAF cross EDR something no commercial vendor even offers as they work either on EDR or WAF.
 
Python code is for better understanding since most cybersec guys use python + EDR

Installation Steps:

Follow detailed_documentation.md steps to install Clickhouse database (from the parent of this directory, Bayesian-Traffic-Prism main repo)

Create table as in this directory..(create_table_for_agent.sql)

Run the Node agent on your required endpoints

Run OLAP query in this repo (OLAP_SQL_detection.sql)

Integrate with your SIEM thru csv export
